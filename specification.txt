this project follows an informal format specification for Tickflow, which is loosely described here:
- all commands must be indented by one level
- use loc labels rather than the label command for gotos
    - for loops or other particularly crash-prone situations, use normal labels but annotate them and the gotos with a comment indicating what their name would be
- loops are indented after the initial label, and get unindented for the break label
- if a label is meant to be callable as a function ("sub", precede it with a comment saying "function [NAME]")
- all custom-made includables must have a prefix in all their members (including those that aren't meant to be used by outsiders)
    - example: games/village.tickflow has the prefix "village_"


------ license ------
this specification can be used by everyone but until it gets merged into Tickompiler or some other Tickflow decompiler, credit patataofcourse (me!) for this specification please
